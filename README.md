# MasSeqViz
MasSeqViz is a powerful tool for visualizing and analyzing isoform expression data generated using 
Mas-Iso-Seq. With MasSeqViz, researchers can explore and compare isoform expression levels 
across different samples and conditions, identify patterns and trends in the data, and gain a deeper 
understanding of the functional impact of context-specific post-transcriptional regulation. Whether 
you are working with bulk or single-cell isoform data, MasSeqViz provides an straightforward solution
for visualizing and interpreting your results. MasSeqViz aim to help researchers using 
Mas-Iso-Seq to study isoform expression and post-transcriptional regulation in their experiments.
